Freedom and Equality
16   Iran’s women and poor have been protesting the regime and Sharia Law and inflation since the revolution in 1979.  In 2020, when women seemed to be making some headway, a crackdown took place in Iran leading to the death and imprisonment of dozens (or more) women.  Population control, segregated schools for children and inheritance laws put the lives of women and children at risk.  Women began using social media to get their message out in 2020, creating thousands of selfies without their headscarfs.  12.  After several unjust beatings and deaths including Mahsa Amini in custody of the Morality Police, the Iranian government responded to domestic outrage in part by shutting down internet connectivity and access to social media.  Anonymous, the Atlas Intelligence Group, and groups of hackers both in Iran and worldwide organized to put pressure on the government to change their oppressive policies.  The hacktivists attacked the Iranian Parlaiment, Iranian celebrities, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to dox government officials.  The hacktivists also shared tips on how to get around the blocking of the internet by the government.  15   Meanwhile, the minimum wage in Iran is $120 per month, and videos depicting unsafe, dehumanizing working conditions have been released.  The leaders of the oil industry are sometimes referred to as a mafia.  Persian Gulf Holding recently were charged with embezzlement of 170 million dollars.  Iranian factory workers frequently strike demanding an increase in wages due to a 50% rate of annual inflation.
Oppression and Policing
2.  Edalat-e Ali is a hackivist group made up of Iranians who work to reveal unfair treatment of prisoners in Iran to the world.  Last year, they hacked damning security camera images of prisoners who were emaciated and non-ambulatory being dragged through the prison, prisoners being beaten, prisoners fainting, and severe overcrowding. Confidential documents were also leaked proving the systematic abuses of inmates.  While hacking the prison’s security footage, they also displayed a message for the prison control room, “Evin prison is a stain of President Ebrahim Raisi’s black turban and white beard.”  Edalat-e Ali also seek the release of political prisoners. After this footage was leaked, a statement was released by the head of Iranian prisons, Mohammad Mehdi, apologising for the “unacceptable behavior.”
Corruption with Leadership
Censorship and Journalism
3. Anonymous has become involved in protecting Iranians from their own government and publicizing protests and demonstrations that have been quelled by Iranian police with gunfire.  7   In 2009, Anonymous began aiding Iranians in conjunction with hackers from Pirate Bay and Iranians with the Iranian Green Movement and a site called Anonymous Iran.  The site was meant to draw worldwide attention and support and allow for information exchange between Iran and the world amid censorship by the Iranian government.  This project followed the unfair election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejab in 2009.  
Corruption
14   Rich Kids of Tehran, or RKOT, is an Instagram account that posts photographs of rich Aghazadeh partaking in illegal activities like women without hijabs, drinking alcohol freely, and celebrating during world imposed or government imposed sanctions were causing suffering among the rest of the population.  RKOT also posted a video of Iran firing missiles that took down flight 752 of Ukraine Internation Airlines in 2020 triggering anti-government protests.  The account is said to be run by the wealthy young nobles themselves, but serves as foder for inequality protests.  Iran frequently denies crimes such as human rights violations, such as the actions of the Morality Police, and actions of the military, such as the missile takedown of flight 752.

Offensive Cyberattacks on the World
5   Modern attacks are primarily motivated by religion and financial sanctions.  In 2013, Operation Ababil by Cyber fighters of Izz Ad-Din Al Qassam supported by the Iranian government led a campaign against US Financial Institutions. The cyber attacks were motivated by sanctions on Iran’s Central Bank.  DOS attacks against JP Morgan and the New York Stock exchange disrupted online banking for Americans.    Hacktivist Groups also attacked Aramco and Las Vegas Sands with Operation Shamoon.  The crippling attacks were following the tightening of US Oil Sanctions and an important donor to Republican Party publicly advocated a nuclear attack on Iran.  8  Hackers called Phospherous were also responsible for hacking email accounts associated with a presidential campaign.
Control or Oppression.  
10   Only about 35% of Iran has access to the internet.  Through sophisticated surveillance of all forms of communication within Iran, the regime continues to increase its real life oppression of those with dissenting voices, silencing them.  Citizens work to gain the ability to access information through the internet, and the regime established “Halal Internet” with nationalist alternatives to foreign media.  Beginning in 2009, Iranian Cybersecurity executed full blown attacks on profile based social media sites from America and China.  The Cyber Defence Division invested 76 million dollars to target online dissidents.  13  The Iranian Cyber Army, or Cyberi, is not officially funded by the Iranian government, but is known to have led these attacks on social media.
Censorship
4   Charlie Hebdo is a satirical weekly magazine from France; in 2020, an Iranian hacker group with Iranian cybersecurity Emennet Pasargad stole the financial reports and the personal details of 230,000 customers of the magazine.  This followed Charlie Hebdo launching a contest for caricatures of the “backward and intolerant” Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  A hacker called HolySouls claiming responsibility ransomed the data for $340,000 in a hacker forum.  This is the same magazine that was physically attacked by Iranian militants in 2015 after publishing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.  Emennet Pasargad is already under sanctions from the US government for interfering in the US election.     6   Operation Ababil was also motivated by the release of a short film called The Innocence of Muslims with anti-Islamic content dubbed over footage in post production depicting footage of violence committed against Copts in Egypt and unflattering depictions of the Prophet Muhammed.
Propaganda and Disinformation
7  Oxford Internet Institute’s Propaganda Project identified Iran as a government that uses social media accounts run by people and bots in foreign influence campaigns.  These campaigns attempt to hide dissent within Iran from the world by spreading propaganda and suppressing political opposition.  Reuters working with FireEye identified 70 websites that targeted 15 countries, including the US and other primarily muslim countries, with Iranian regime propaganda.  11   This year, a fake twitter account of a Sara Shokoulhi posing as an Iranian psychologist used stolen photos and text to phish researchers of the Atlantic Council.  The account was proven by hacktivists to be an effort to target important human rights advocates by Charming Kitten.
Intel
5   Until 2013, Iran primarily probed the US and other countries mining for data, but after 2013, direct disruptive attacks began on organizations and governments as their abilities increased.  9   Parastoo Newscaster’s (also known as Apt42, Group 83, Newsbeef, G0058 or Charming Kitten) primary domestic actions include making online contact with protest leaders in Iran and human rights activists in the West posing as well known researchers or journalists, such as reporters from the New York Times.  This contact is used to gain information about confidential information such as human rights group operatives, cyber attack intel, planned protests and movements, and the spread of dissenting information.  The regime then uses this stolen information in works to suppress these individuals and movements with physical policing.
