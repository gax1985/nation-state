## Iranian Regime's Allies 




#### Syria


Iran was competing with Russia in terms of exercising control of Syria. They are the Syrian president's ally, and they have supported his regime with intelligence, weapons, funds, personnel (not accounting the Shia militias that fought in the Syrian civil war - originating from Iraq, Afghanistan, and other countries). The Syrian regime is obliged to fulfil their obligations to the Iranian government. Syria also holds another holy site for Shia Islam, which is the shrine of the prophet's daughter Fatima, which is located in Damascus. 


> [!tldr] 
> Look into the status of Iran's dominion over Syria.
> Check for the Syrian Electronic Army's activities involving lending direct assistance to the Iranian regime. 
> Check for the Free Syrian Electronic Army's activities in the past, especially if their efforts were directed against the Iranian regime. 
 


#### Hezbollah 

They have an international drug-smuggling, weapons smuggling and human trafficking ring. They control Southern Lebanon, and control a large portion of the Cannabis fields in Lebanon. They have expanded into Keptagon production in Syria (Keptagon is a cheap-to-manufacture stimulant, which is routinely smuggled into the Persian gulf countries. There have been notable seizures of massive quantities of this drug from Jordanian, Kuwait and Saudi Arabian borders). They participated in the Syrian Civil War, as well as the current hostilities with Israel.

> [!todo] 
> 1. Examine their smuggling routes (as it provides funds for themselves. Look for evidence of them financing the Iranian regime, as they are its proxy)
> 2. Check for cyber operations from Hezbollah's side directly
> 3. Check the history of their involvement in the Syrian civil war.  
> 4. Check for evidence of the offensive Iranian cyber program aiding Hezbollah's operations.

#### Iraq 

It has been under Iranian influence for years now. A large population of Iraq are Shias, and one of the holiest sites of Shia Islam is located in Iraq, which is called "Karbala". It was the scene of the killing of Hassan and Hussein, the prophet's cousin's sons (Ali Ibn Abi Taleb's sons). Shia pilgrims visit it as often as possible.


> [!todo] 
> Check for any cyber operations stemming from Iraq to aid Iran (possibly?)
> Outline the strategic importance of Iraq to Iran (especially since it has one of the holiest sites in Shia Islam)
> Examine the Iraq-Iran conflict(1980-1988), and the prosecution of Shias in Iraq following the First Gulf War (1990)
