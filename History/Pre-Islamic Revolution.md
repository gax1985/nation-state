## 1979 : Islamic Revolution


The 1979 Islamic-Revolution in Iran was a revolution that did not fit the western definition of what a Revolution is. Typically, revolutions that have happened in the past were by the underprivileged being united as a front against the privileged class, which often happens to be either affiliated with the state or considered to be a part of the state's apparatus.  This revolution united both rich and poor against the Shah's dynastic monarchy. 

The spearhead of this revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini, was on the minds of many Iranians as an almost-divine figure, as the people who followed him considered his words as divine. The political scene in those times ranged across idealogies, but it was mostly Islamist-leaning, followed by Marxist-Leninist (Iranian Revolution of February 1979. Middle East Institute).
