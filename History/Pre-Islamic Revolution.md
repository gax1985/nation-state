#### The 1953 Iranian Coup



- Iran's feelings towards the United States go back a long way in modern history, but one can say it would originate from the CIA-backed coup in Iran that topped Iran's democratically-elected prime minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, and ushered in Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's rule as the Shah of Iran. The CIA publicly admitted their role in the coup-de-tat in 2013.

- #### The US and British role in the 1953 Anti-Mosaddeq coup-de-tat 


Mossadeq as a prime minister was a thorn on the United Kingdom's side, as he had nationalized the British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which we all know today as BP. He was highly distrustful of the United Kingom, and the British thought that the coup would help protect their interests by installing Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as the Shah of Iran. At the time, they could not do it alone, and they needed the US' assistance in making it a reality. The operation was nicknamed TPAJAX by the CIA, and Operation Boot by the United Kingdom's MI6. The Shah ruled until the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. The Iranian public, especially when considering how the Shah's rule started, mistrusted both the United Kingdom and the United States of America due to their previous meddling in Iran's political sphere.

The type of government that was in place was a Dynastic Monarchy.


#### The SAVAK : The Shah's Intelligence Service

Iran was extremely liberal before the revolution. Politically. Iran was the US' and Israel's best friend in the region; there was substantial collaboration : Creation of SAVAK.

SAVAK was created in 1957, and the name refers to the Organization of Intelligence and Security of the Nation. The agency hunted for communists and leftists, as the Cold War was very much alive at that time. The CIA and the Israeli Mossad both were part of its existence in the fearsome fashion in Iranian minds, and the oppression meted by the Shah's SAVAK paved the way to the 1979 Islamic Revolution(Karimi & Gambrell, n.d.).

Reasons for the revolution : Oppression of the king's security apparatus, (hatred of the US and Israel as they both assisted in the creation of SAVAK "The security apparatus for the Shah")

#### 1979 : Islamic Revolution


The 1979 Islamic-Revolution in Iran was a revolution that did not fit the western definition of what a Revolution is. Typically, revolutions that have happened in the past were by the underprivileged being united as a front against the privileged class, which often happens to be either affiliated with the state or considered to be a part of the state's apparatus.  This revolution united both rich and poor against the Shah's dynastic monarchy. 

The spearhead of this revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini, was on the minds of many Iranians as an almost-divine figure, as the people who followed him considered his words as divine. The political scene in those times ranged across ideologies, but it was mostly Islamist-leaning, followed by Marxist-Leninist ((The Iranian Revolution of February 1979, n.d.).

Thus, it we are to consider Iran as a nation-state in the cyber-warfare front, it would be logical to consider when thinking of the likely motivations of Iran's offensive cyber program to also carry on the torch of the religious foundation of Islamic Iran(Personal opinion). 



>Katulis, B., Sariolghalam, M., Authors, V., & Rogenhofer, J. M. (2023, September 26). _The Iranian Revolution of February 1979_. Middle East Institute. https://www.mei.edu/publications/iranian-revolution-february-1979



The Islamic Revolution of 1979 brought with it four major events that shaped the present political reality in the Middle East, and the Persian Gulf region more specifically. The event that invited further American presence in the Middle East region was the American Hostage Crisis of 1979, where 52 Americans were taken hostage by revolutionaries for 444 days in the American Embassy. The American public then saw the Iranian revolutionaries with great disdain, similar to how the Israeli public sees Hamas now due to their recent attack on  Yom Kippur. The second event was Iraq's attempted invasion of Iran in 1980. Saddam Hussein wanted to extinguish the revolutionary fire, as it could potentially mean the revolution spreading beyond Iran's borders. What he feared became reality, as Hezbollah and Hamas exist today as proxies of Iran. Saddam Hussein received the support of the leaders of the Persian gulf countries, as they saw a monarch being deposed by revolution, and considered the Shia population that live within their respective borders. Saddam's war against Iran achieved  results that he did not want : the Iranian people flocking to Khomeini, and the advancement of Iran's revolutionary pogrom outside of its borders.

The invasion of Kuwait was the next event that came as a consequence ; an 8-year war is financially draining on a country's economy. The first Gulf War of 1991 invited a technologically-superior opponent to Saddam Hussein, and the United States of America came along with the coalition forces to liberate Kuwait. After the liberation of Kuwait, American forces stayed in Kuwait, and other bases in the Persian Gulf. This is understandable as being a potential threat to Iran, who had a very real demonstration to the US' technologically-superior army. This point, in my opinion, invited a deeper interest in advancing Iran's computing program. The challenge of the American sanctions placed a hurdle in Iran's computing path, as the economy was severely challenged.
