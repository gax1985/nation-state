Human Rights and Hacktivists (Justina): 

1. There were some groups inside Iran motivated by : 
	1. Democracy 
	2. Human rights
	3. Basic freedoms
	4. Underlining Motivation : Exposure of the Regime's corruption 
			Twitter :
				@ RKOT : Posting tweets about the regime's actions to opress protestors, women etc ...
				@ RichKidsOfTehran : Iran keeps trying to shut it down, so they keep altering the name slightly. They are trying to sow unrest among Iranians, because the wealthy are immune to prosecutions and the regime's policies ; there will be pictues of rich Iranians drinking, dressing in bikinis, smoking cigarettes/cannabis. If a poor person tried to do that, they would be murdered.

	 5. The Kurdish Movement
				Kurdish groups have been fighting for independence in areas where the Kurdish people in Iran are based. The groups waged an armed resistance against the regime.

 It would help tremendously to check for the Iranian regime's surveillance efforts against the Kurdish population.
>The protest movements prior to Mahsa Amini's death, and the Iranian regime's surveillance efforts to counter the protest movement.  Mahsa was Kurdish. Her unfortunate death is a double-blow, as she demonstrated the oppression of the Iranian regime against women and against the Kurdish community. 

>	6. The Ahwaz Movement
>						It involves a small Arab community in the city of Ahwaz. There has been a lot of discrimination involving the Arab community there.

> Check if there has been any cyber attacks involving the Ahwaz population
> Check for surveillance efforts against the Ahwaz population.

7. The Mujahdeen Khalq Movement
