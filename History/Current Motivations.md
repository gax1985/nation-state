Human Rights and Hacktivists (Justina): 

1. There were some groups inside Iran motivated by : 
	1. Democracy 
	2. Human rights
	3. Basic freedoms 
	4. Underlining Motivation : Exposure of the Regime's corruption 
			Twitter :
				@ RKOT : Posting tweets about the regime's actions to opress protestors, women etc ...
				@ RichKidsOfTehran : Iran keeps trying to shut it down, so they keep altering the name slightly. They are trying to sow unrest among Iranians, because the wealthy are immune to prosecutions and the regime's policies ; there will be pictues of rich Iranians drinking, dressing in bikinis, smoking cigarettes/cannabis. If a poor person tried to do that, they would be murdered.
