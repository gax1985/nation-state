On the day of the 23rd of August, 1979, the Kurdish population of the town of Mohabad seized control. The city of Mohabad is a central figure in the Iranian side of Kurdistan, as it was the de-facto capital of the independent Kurdish Republic duting the period of 1946-1947. . The revolt was triggered by the seizure of power in the nearby town of Paveh by the local Kurdish tribes. The trend continued on to the towns of Saqqaz, Divan Darreh and finally the town of Mohabad. 

In terms of the  Iranian-Kurdish population's sentiments about the 1979 Islamic Revolution, they have felt a tremendous disappointment towards it, as it did not improve their circumstances of achieving their goal of full-autonomy over the Kurdish regions of Iran. Early in 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini met the Kurdish leaders of Iran, and warned them against their ambitions of autonomy. Afterwards, Khomeini ordered their arrest, and that meant a life in hiding. From among the Kurds that fought in the uprising of Mohabad, they expressed the sentiment of fighting for more autonomy over their regions, but not to be completely cut-off from the rest of Iran.

After Mohabad was under Kurdish control, the Iranian government ordered the Iranian Armed forces to attack the city. The Air Force conducted severe aerial bombardments of the city. The reported casualties by the Kurdish population were exceeding 600 deaths. The rebels fled to the hills with their light weaponry, amongst the ruins of their heavy machinery seized from the Shah's army.  The Iranian government's response in those times echoes a voice from their future, where summary executions were common place in these events, where 80 Iranian-Kurds were sent to their deaths by a firing-squad. In the field of rhetoric, the Iranian government reported that four Israeli soldiers, a French individual and 2 Iraqi officers were arrested in Iranian-Kurdistan.

The individual who was tasked with resolving the Mohabad uprising was Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkhali, who was the head of the Revolutionary Court. After the Iranian army took control of the Kurdish towns, summary trials followed shortly by summary executions happened to boys and men for alleged revolutionary participation in the events of their towns.
