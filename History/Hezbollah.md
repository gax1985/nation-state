## Origins of Hezbollah







On October 23rd 1983, an event occurred that gave birth to the group that we know today as Hezbollah. A young man from a Shi'a family in Lebanon drove a truck laden with explosives through the gates of  the U.S. Marine Battalion Headquarters Building in Beirut. A second attacker attacked the French Multinational Force building. The attacks claimed the lives of 241 American citizens, and 58 French nationals. The Lebanese Civil War is the reason for the current political horizon in Lebanon, where the war has caused the divisions that are latent in the country. The 1982 Israeli Invasion of Lebanon provided the backdrop for a scene where Iranian agents organized the multitude of militias into a single wing : Hezbollah. The October 23rd attack happened after the US Embassy bombing of April 18th 1983, which killed 63 individuals. 


The group was responsible for at least 24 terror attacks over the span of 9 months in the year of 1985. Iran aimed to dissuade countries from arming its opponent Iraq in the Iraq-Iran War of 1980-1988, and Iran utilized its proxy Hezbollah to do so. Hezbollah's targets ranged in the Middle East, but there were instances of attacks occurring in locations such as Germany or the Republic of the Congo.

The persons who were planned and coordinated the attack ,  Imad Mughniyeh and his brother in law Mustapha Badreddine, watched the attack happen through binoculars from a nearby building.
Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah was considered to be the spiritual head of the group, and while he was fully apreciative of Iran's copious assistance to the group, he never agreed fully with a key concept of Islamic Iran, which was "Rule of the Jurisprudent", which gave Khomeini the the status of the Mahdi, who is a special figure in Shi'a Islam. The group's current leader, Hassan Nasrallah, saw an Islamic Republic in Lebanon was an aim to seek. He became leader of the group in 1992.

Hezbollah's roots go back to the 1960's and the 1970s Shia Islamic revival in Lebanon. When Israel withdrew from Southern Lebanon in 2000, the military wing of the group, Islamic Resistance, had enough firepower to surpass the capabilities of the Lebanese Army. In 1985, Hezbollah formally announced its establishment, and declared that its enemies are the United States of America and the Soviet Union, and called for the destruction of Israel. After the Taif Accord of 1989, which effectively ended the Lebanese Civil War, there were calls for the disarmament of militias, and Hezbollah changed its military wing's name to Islamic Resistance in a bid to keep its weapons. In 1992, the group successfully participated in the national elections.
In 2006, Hezbollah fighters went on a cross-border attack which ended up with eight Israeli soldiers being killed and two being kidnapped. This triggered the 2006 conflict, as Israel responded, and Hezbollah responded back with launching 4000 rockets at Israel. 

In 2011, Hezbollah and its allies had forced the collapse of the unity government of Saad Hariri. This has happened due to four members of Hezbollah being accused of involvement of the 2005 assassination of Saad Hariri's father, Rafik Al Hariri. 

As the Syrian civil war escalated in Syria, the group stood with the side of Bashar Al Assad, which helped in tipping the scales for the Syrian president via aiding the Syrian army in recapturing territory lost to rebels. The group's involvement in Syria has led to animosities taking place between Hezbollah and the Persian Gulf's Arab states, and in 2016, the group was named a terrorist group by the Arab League, with Saudi Arabia pushing the wheels on this motion.
